This is mostly a reference for me, but I figured it's worth sharing. Here's our list of "essential" Portland restaurants that we find ourselves returning
to, along with some honorable mentions.

## Spots that never disappoint

- [Kinboshi Ramen](https://www.kinboshiramen.com/): This is our favorite ramen in Portland and we frequent it more than any other restaurant in the city.
- [Khao Moo Dang](https://www.kmdpdx.com/): I'm always blown away by their flavorful meat and noodle dishes. Perfect for a cold day.
- [Jaqueline Restaurant](https://jacquelinepdx.com/): An exceptional seafood-focused place in Southeast.
- [Little Griddle](https://littlegriddlecafe.com/): A tiny, non-nonsense breakfast spot that we love. They have our favorite pancakes.
- [Yama Sushi](https://yamasushiportland.com/): Excellent sushi spot with other Japanese dishes.
- [East India Company](https://eicpdx.com/): Great, consistent Indian food downtown.
- [Lovely's Fifty Fifty](https://www.lovelys5050.com/): Out-of-this world pizza on Mississippi. I didn't know pizza could taste this good.
- [Stammitsh](https://www.stammtischpdx.com/): Awesome German spot that's perfect for grabbing some schnitzel and a stout on a drizzly winter day. Also, no IPAs! Their sister restaurant [Prost!](https://www.prostportland.com/) on Mississippi has a smaller menu but is just as good.
- [La Bonita](https://labonitapdx.com/): Casual Mexican spot with consistently good burritos and nachos.
- [Mediterranean Exploration Company](https://www.sesamecollective.com/mecs): Our go-to spot for celebrations. [Shallom Ya'll](https://www.sesamecollective.com/shalomyall) is the same owners and is just as good.
- [Pip's Donuts and Chai](https://www.pipsoriginalonline.com/): A classic Portland spot that makes mini donuts and specality chais. They also give you free donuts on your birthday!
- [Cadillac Cafe](https://www.cadillaccafepdx.com/?utm_content=45b267c6-db58-439f-8d4a-166b70c6e353): Another brunch option that never disappoints
- [Sweedeedee](https://www.sweedeedee.com/menu): Eating here always feels like a quintessential hipster experience, but the food is excellent and it's always busy on the weekends.
- [Rimsky-Korsakoffee House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P3xeTdVNiaQBurZs7): A late-night coffee and dessert place with an abundance of personality.
- [Gado Gado](https://www.gadogadopdx.com/): Indonesian place with a variety of interesting dishes. Would highly recommend their Rice Table tasting menu
- [Yokohama Skyline Eatery](https://www.yokohamaskylinepdx.com/): A basement ramen shop with a delicious black-garlic broth.
- [GrindWitTryz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6kYL1srTQtfvKHA7): Family-run Hawaiian place with massive, hearty portions.
