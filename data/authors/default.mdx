I am currently an engineer at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), an enterprise software company. I work specifically on [Workday Extend](https://www.workday.com/en-us/pages/workday-cloud-platform-apps.html), developing web applications which allow you to customize Workday's core product.

I'm an ambitious frontend developer, with lots of [projects](/projects) in the works.

I formally worked at Garmin AT, developing the [next generation of avionics for general aviation aircraft](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/cInTheAir-c582-p1.html).

Outside of I work I am an avid runner and cyclist. I've recently fallen in love with gravel biking. I also fly small planes; I earned my commercial pilot certificate in 2021. I'm hoping to become a flight instructor next.

I'm also an avid photographer, especially when I'm traveling. All the photos on this site are my own.
